//  Actions:
//  Any time data is manipulated, it goes here.

//  the only functions that should remain in the components are handle click functions, 
//     which will dispatch the actions.



// actions that dont update state, but are saving data to the database, these are sagas.
// sagas handle asynchronous calls that dont manipulate state

// potentially dont need those


// grab all initial data(set state initially)

// update logged in user(grab profile/name, set state)

// save profile to DB on creation(also set it to state)

// add trip(save to current trips array in state)

// select trip(update selected trip state)

// select connection (set connectipn user/profile to state)

// select connected user(set users convo to state)

// send message(update db and state)
